<!-- DATA COLLECTING AND MODELING -->
## 📚 Data Collecting and Modeling

All data used in this project were scraped between from [hkmovie6](https://hkmovie6.com/), a website that displays real-time showtimes and seatplan data, between October 2021 and June 2022.

Three scrapers were built to extract 🎞️movie data, 🎫showtime data, and 💺seat occupancy data respectively.

Each scraper has its own pipeline to process and transform the data before writing to a SQLite database. Up to 13 June 2022, they have scraped data of 445 movies and 122,897 shows.
