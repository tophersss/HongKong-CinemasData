<!-- DATA COLLECTING AND MODELING -->
## 📚 Data Collecting and Modeling

All data used in this project were scraped from [hkmovie6](https://hkmovie6.com/) from October 2021 to June 2022.

Three scrapers were built to extract 🎞️movies data, 🎫showtimes data, and 💺seats occupancy data respectively.

Each scraper has its own pipeline to process and transform the data before eventually writing to a SQLite database. Up to 13 June 2022, they have scraped data of 445 movies and 122,897 shows.
